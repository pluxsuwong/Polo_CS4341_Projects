The effective branching factor for each of the 5 worlds will be 4^n:
World 1: 
World 2: 
World 3: 
World 4: 
World 5: 

Heuristics 4 and 5 seemed to be more effective than 1, 2, and 3. Using Heuristics 1 and 2 generated the same series of movements, but heuristic 1 expanded more nodes than heuristic 2 did. Heuristic 5 expanded even less nodes than Heuristics 1 - 4.
