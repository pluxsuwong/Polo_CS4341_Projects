Instruction on Execution:

1. Open the terminal and type in the command:
	
	python ga.py [puzzle] [input] [time]

	Where:
		- ga.py: is the name of the source file for the genetic algorithm
		- [puzzle]: The number that indicates the puzzle (from 1 to 3; 1 being the first puzzle, 2 being the second, 3 being the third)
        	- [input]: is the input for each puzzle as a .txt file e.g. puzzle_1.txt
		- [time]: the number of time in seconds that the code would run for. More time equivalates to more generations


2. An input generator is also available for generating input file:

	python gen_input.py [puzzle]

	Where:
		- gen_input.py: is the source file for the generator
		- [puzzle]: The number that indicates the puzzle (from 1 to 3; 1 being the first puzzle, 2 being the second, 3 being the third)
