Instruction on Execution:

1. Open a terminal and type in the command:
	
	python ga.py [puzzle] [input] [time]

	Where:
		- ga.py: is the name of the source file for the genetic algorithm
		- [puzzle]: the number that indicates the puzzle (from 1 to 3; 1 being the first puzzle, 
            2 being the second, 3 being the third)
        - [input]: is the input for each puzzle as a .txt file e.g. puzzle_input_1.txt
		- [time]: the number of time in seconds that the code would run for. More time 
            equivalates to more generations

    Output:
        - single csv file of P_x_N_y.csv, for puzzle x

    Notes:
        - a constant defined at the top of ga.py determines whether elitism and/or culling should 
            be used. By default, the genetic algorithm uses a combination of both elitism and 
            culling.

2. An input generator is also available for generating input files:

	python gen_input.py [puzzle]

	Where:
		- gen_input.py: is the source file for the generator
		- [puzzle]: the number that indicates the puzzle (from 1 to 3; 1 being the first puzzle, 
            2 being the second, 3 being the third)

3. A BASH script is also available for multiple executions:

    ./run_tests.sh

    Where:
        - run_tests.sh is the script file in the project directory

    Output:
        - three directories of P_x, for puzzle x
        - five csv files in each directory of P_x_N_y.csv, for puzzle x
    
4. A BASH script for folder clean up is also available:

    ./clean_tests.sh

    Where:
        - clean_tests.sh is the script file in the project directory

    Output:
        - subdirectories of P_* are removed
